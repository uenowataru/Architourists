	public static String getIntro() {
		return "Barcelona was founded by the Romans and originally, was enclosed in the walls built by them. It’s just only after 1855, that they put down walls and expanded the city and districts like Eixample and villages like Gracia was incorporated into the city. This part of the city is now known as the Old city, and has a ‘Romanesque’ architecture. Starting with the Residencia Onix, it first goes to Arc de Triomf, which also is the nearest metro station. This arc was developed in 1888 for the World Exposition and celebrated as the arch for welcoming all the nations. Just at the walkable distance from Onix, it is a must watch site along with a big complex behind it which is a common public space for the natives. After that, it takes you to the  Palau de la Música Catalana, which is concert hall and a part of prestige World heritage site by UNESCO. The design of the Palau is typical of Catalan modernism in that curves predominate over straight lines, dynamic shapes are preferred over static forms, and rich decoration that emphasizes floral and other organic motifs is used extensively. Then, it goes to Barcelona Cathedral which is a good site to visit. Situated in the Plaza de Sant lu, it is a church built in 14th century. The plaza itself offers a beautiful view. Afterwards, the tour goes to Placa dei Rei i.e. King’s square. This whole journey, if covered on feet (as the tour suggests) is a very pleasurable one as you get to go through the core of the old city, which even today reflects the Roman architecture. The plaza itself is delight to watch and holds historical significance to it as well. Next stop is Santa Maria del Mar, which is an imposing church in the Ribera district. It is an outstanding example of Catalan Gothic, with a purity and unity of style that are very unusual in large mediaeval buildings. Next up is Museu Picasso, which houses one of the most extensive collections of artworks by the 20th-century Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. With more than 3,500 works by the painter, the museum has the most complete collection of works. The museum is housed in five adjoining medieval palaces in Barcelona's La Ribera and is located on Montcada Street in the (Bank District) of Barcelona. The next station is Parc de la Ciutadella, which is a historic park built in mid-19th century, and hosts the city's substantial zoo (which was home to the famous albino gorilla Snowflake), the Parliament of Catalonia, a lake, some museums, and a fountain of considerable size designed by Josep Fontserè.";
