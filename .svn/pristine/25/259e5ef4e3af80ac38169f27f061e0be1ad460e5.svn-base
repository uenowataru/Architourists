				"Agbar Tower, which is actually acronym for Agua (Ag) Barcelona (bar), is a recent addition to the Barcelona skyline but is not open to the general public and has no public viewing deck. It is a 38 story (four underground, thirty-four above ground), 144m / 474ft tall bullet looking building with 4400 windows. It has many other derogatory names as well \n\nThe building has a double facade, meaning two faces. These are made up of two concentric concrete oval cylinders, which do not come in contact with each other. A dome of glass and steel, which gives the tower its characteristic shape of a bullet, covers the outer cylinder, which completely encases the inner cylinder.  The inner cylinder is where the lifts stairs, and facilities are located. \n\nOne of the most characteristic elements of the building, which really brings out its awe and shape, is its nocturnal illumination. The windows of the building comprise of more than 4,500 luminous devices that can operate independently using LED technology and enables the generation of images on the outside of the tower. The system is capable of creating 16 million colors, thanks to a sophisticated system of hardware and software. It has the ability to quickly transition between colors, which can create a shocking effect. The system of the building, dubbed by its creator Yann Kersalé as diffraction, who defined it as 'a vaporous cloud of color that seeks moiré', is often used in the celebration of various events. \n\nWhat is great about the construction of this building, even before taking into consideration the lights, is the play it has on the skyline with the Sagrada Familia. The two buildings are completely different in style but they both have such an influence on the skyline of Barcelona. In different postcards and images of Barcelona, you will usually see these next to each other, even though they are quite apart. It shows a very contrasting image of the styles of architecture that have passed through the history of the city, and that is wonderful.\n\nIn the design of the Agbar Tower, Nouvel actually said he rejected the prevailing opinion in North America of what a skyscraper should look like, hence the phallic shape. It is the architect's intention to give the impression of land that is emerging in a special way out of the ground. The use of the tower by a water utility company led him to the design: a metaphor of a geyser sprouting from the deep sea.   \n\nIt is said however by critics that a flaw in the architecture is that the structure does not have a great idea on how the building meets the ground, even with that as its intended design, and that this situation itself ruins the overall design.\n\n\n\n");

				"Origin: Built for the World Expo 1888.\n\nThe arch was designed by the noted Catalan architect Josep Vilaseca as a symbol of Catalan pride for welcoming the nations for World Expo 1888. Unlike many triumphal arches, like in Arc de Triomphe Paris, it is made of red bricks than sandstone or marble. Another striking feature of the arch is that the architecture is inspired by Muslim architecture. The style is known as “Mudéjar” which emerged during the 12th century on the Iberian Peninsula. The style was created by the Moors and Muslims who remained in the area after the Christians had recaptured and repopulated the whole Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe arch is dominated by its several beautiful stone carvings. Above the arch itself, visitors can see carvings depicting the Barcelona coat of arms with a small crown above it. On either side of the Barcelona coat of arms, one can see the coat of arms of the other provinces in Spain. The relief on one side depicts a prize giving ceremony and is known as “Recompense”. The relief on the other side is known as “Barcelona rep les nacions”, Catalan for “Barcelona welcomes the nations”. It represents the various countries' participation in the World Expo and Barcelona thanking them for their attendance.\n\nFurther, there is a man in the middle who bears the Barcelona coat of arms on his chest. The crosses, which are red on a white background, represent the patron saint of Barcelona; Saint George. The striped sections, which are red on a yellow background, represent the Catalonian coat of arms. The legend has it that the red stripes are the blood from a mortal wound the Barcelona Count, Wilfred the Hairy, suffered during the defense of Barcelona against the Moors in the 9th century. The blood is said to have been painted on the Count’s golden shield by the French ally, Charles the Bold, as a sign of gratitude.\n\nSurrounding the arch stands twelve angels representing fame. Arc de Triomf is crowned by yet another coat of arms. The one at the top represents the arms of the Spanish monarchs. The pillars held by the lions are known as the Pillars of Hercules, which is the ancient name given to the Strait of Gibraltar. Under the lions, even though it can be hard to spot from ground, stands the words “Plus Ultra” – a motto which means “Further and beyond” in Latin.\n\n\n\n");

				"The Barcelona Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Barcelona. Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia may be Barcelona's most famous landmark (and rightly so), but La Seu, which is another name for the Cathedral, still holds it own as one of the most impressive cathedrals in Spain.  The rich detail in the Cathedral is something notable of many churches of the Gothic period. It is truly remarkable how the designs of the old times were made by hand, using no technology but a couple of rulers and pencils and papers.  A blending of medieval and Renaissance styles, Barcelona's cathedral features large bell towers covered in Gothic pinnacles, high Gothic arches, a handsomely sculptured choir and many side chapels with rich altarpieces. The interior was recently cleaned. Especially notable is the Cappella de Sant Benet behind the altar, with a magnificent 15th-century interpretation of the crucifixion by Bernat Matorell.\n\nSuch rich history as well goes with this magnificent establishment. The cathedral is dedicated to Eulália of Barcelona, co-patron saint of Barcelona, a young virgin who, according to Catholic tradition, suffered martyrdom during Roman times in the city. One story says that she was exposed naked in the public square and a miraculous snowfall in mid-spring covered her nudity. The enraged Romans put her into a barrel with knives stuck into it and rolled it down a street (according to tradition, the one now called Baixada de Santa Eulàlia). The body of Saint Eulalia is entombed in the cathedral's crypt.\n\nOne of the most beautiful parts of the Cathedral, with a wonderful play of light coming through the top, is the cloister, with its vaulted galleries overlooking a lush garden filled with orange, medlar and palm trees and a mossy central pond. Underneath the well-worn slabs of its stone floor are the tombs of key members of the Barri Gòtic's ancient guilds.\n\nThe structure sits on the site of an ancient Roman basilica built in 343 A.D. The Basilica was destroyed in 985. A Roman cathedral, built between 1046 and 1058, replaced the ruined basilica. Between 1257 and 1268, a chapel, the Capella de Santa Llucia, was added.\n\nIn addition to Saints Eulàlia and Olegarius, the cathedral contains the tombs of Saint Raymond of Penyafort, Count Ramon Berenguer I and his third wife Almodis de la Marche, and bishops Berenguer de Palou II, Salvador Casañas y Pagés, an Arnau de Gurb, who is buried in the Chapel of Santa Llúcia, which he had constructed and which was the only thing left after 1268, when the entire prior structure except for the Santa Llucia Chapel was demolished to make way for the Gothic cathedral.\n\n\n\n");

				"This pavilion was designed as the German Pavilion for the 1929 International Exposition in Barcelona.  The event was 6 months long and afterwards the pavilion was destroyed because the German government didn’t find a buyer. After many years, however, In 1980 Oriol Bohigas put the project for reconstruction in motion in 1980, designating the architects Ignasi de Solà-Morales, Cristian Cirici and Fernando Ramos to research, design and supervise the reconstruction.  It became a keypoint in Mies Van der Rohe’s career and also of the century as emblematic of the Modernist Movement.  As shocking as it may seem, the Pavilion itself had no real use.  The work of Mies is very much brought out in this pavilion with his ongoing motto through his career, “less is more.” The Pavilion is asymmetric and fluid with a continuous flow of space.  Wall transitions are made of both glass and marble. \n\nMies always tried to use the most minimal structure possible in his buildings in order to keep them standing, an idea so grand and formal and aesthetically pleasing. It gave his building feminist characteristics, making them look slim and beautiful. He always worked on a grid and he always designed everything down to where the furniture was placed.  In the pavilion we can see this with the mullions and floor. The 4 corner mullions and floor cracks line up perfectly.  The mullions also, as a way to show minimalism, are in the shape of a cross in order to take away the most of the structure possible, visually. Mies was known also for using the finest of materials in all of his structures. Here, the Pavilion uses 4 different types of marble, Roman Travertine, Green Alpine, Ancient Green, and Golden Onyx, and 4 different types of glass, transparent, milky white, translucent, and opaque black. \n\nMies wanted to give off the feel of enclosed space, without ever having the space actually enclosed. Also, Mies always tried to make a sense, at some point, of looking from a non-enclosed space, through the “enclosed” space, to another non-enclosed area.  This can be seen by the way the walls are partitioned to where they do not make enclosing corners. \n\nToday the pavilion just serves as a landmark and a site for observation in its original location next to MNAC.\n\n\n\n");

Construction for this site began in 1882 but Architect Antoni Gaudi did not get involved until 1883 mixing Gothic and Art Nouveau elements to the basilica. Upon Gaudi’s death in 1926, La Sagrada Familia was only between 15 and 25 percent complete and when asked about the slow construction process Gaudi responded “my client is not in a hurry.” Construction resumed until the Spanish Civil War in 1936. The church was never designed to be a cathedral (the seat of a bishop), which is why in November of 2010 it was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI as a minor basilica. \n\nThe church, upon completion, will have three grand façades: the Nativity facade to the East, the Passion facade to the West, and the Glory facade to the South (this one has not been completed). The Nativity facade is dedicated to the birth of Jesus and is decorated with scenes that allude to the creation of life. The Passion facade is dedicated to the Passion of Christ (Jesus’s suffering during His crucifixion) and is reduced to a barebones (very simple) style of construction. The Glory facade (not completed) is going to show the ascension of Christ to heaven and the road believers have to take to get there. This facade will also depict Hell and purgatory.\n\n\n\n");

				"Casa Mila, also known as la Pedrera (meaning “The Quarry”), was completed in 1912 and was one of Gaudi’s most iconic buildings for its lack of 90-degree angles, which was signature of his designs.  It was this particularly amazing feature of his structures that made his buildings so amazing and sought out by public for their out-of-the-ordinary looks. \n\n This amazing house was commissioned by Mr. Pere Mila, whom was married to a rich widow, Mrs. Roser Segimon. They wanted to live in a spectacular house in the most cosmopolitan avenue of the Barcelona of the time: the Passeig de Gracia. Gaudí was their choice of architect, mainly because he had just built the nearby Casa Batlló building, which was considered the very latest example of the modernist architecture at the time. Mila wanted his house to be even bigger and more monumental than Casa Batlló. \n\nIt was a controversial design in its time for the bold forms of the undulating stone facade and wrought iron decoration of the balconies and windows, designed largely by Josep Maria Jujol, who also created some of the plaster ceilings. Architecturally it is considered an innovative work for its steel structure and curtain walls.  The façade itself is self-supporting.  This means that it is free of the functions of a load-bearing wall, which connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system sets large openings in the façade, giving light to the homes and free structuring of the different levels, thus the walls can be demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify the interior layout of the homes without problems. \n\nOther innovative elements were the construction of underground car parking and separate lifts and stairs for the owners and their servants.  In the time of its design, the use of cars was just becoming a norm, and thus Gaudi had wanted to design an innovative way to get the cars up to the apartments themselves with a spiral parking deck like ramp. Unfortunately, the site was not large enough and this design idea failed.\n\nOne of the most significant parts of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights or staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed with timber coated with limestone, broken marble or glass, have become real sculptures integrated into the building.\n\n\n\n");

				"A Gaudí masterpiece, this house is a remodel of a previously built house. In 1904, the Batlló family bought the house and commissioned Antoni Gaudí to redesign it. It is locally dubbed Casa dels ossos (House of Bones) for its skeletal and organic quality. This house, like all of Gaudí’s work, is in the Modernisme or Art Nouveau style. The front façade is decorated with mosaic made of broken ceramic and glass pieces, a technique called trencadís, leading up to an arched roof that resembles a dragon. The cross at the top, along with the allusion to the dragon, is a representation of the story of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia, who slayed a dragon.\n\nIn 1954, an insurance company named Seguros Iberia bought Casa Batlló and set up offices inside following the Batlló family’s death. It wasn’t until 1993 that the current owners of the site bought the home and continued to refurbish it. It is now open to the public to tour and only one person still remains a resident.\n\n\n\n");

The slope of Montjuic was chosen as the site of the “new” cemetery, in order to keep away from the pressures of urban housing developments.  This was believed to help because at this time in history it was believed that burial sites should be kept away from the cities, rather than being inherent towards the city.  The hillside of the mountain is what gives the site its special character, compared to many other cemeteries that are on flat land, with winding paths and terraced areas looking seaward.  There is such a rich juxtaposition in the cemetery between the different styles of architecture and art: Classic and Gothic styles, along with Art Nouveau.\n\nA walk through this haven of peace reveals valuable funerary architecture and sculpture, in a setting comprising Mediterranean plants and trees, and magnificent sea views. It is truly a site to see.\n\n\n\n");

It was created in 1984 by Tapies to promote the study and knowledge of modern and contemporary art. The building itself was design by the Modernist architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner under the former name Editorial Montaner i Simon publishing house. It opened as the Fundacio in June of 1990. The Fundació’s building is 'hemmed in' between the two side walls of the adjacent buildings. To elevate its height and underscore its new identity, Antoni Tàpies created the sculpture crowning the building entitled Núvol i cadira (Cloud and Chair, 1990). This sculpture represents a chair jutting out of a large cloud. The chair, a recurring motif in Tàpies’ works, alludes to a meditative attitude and to aesthetic contemplation.\n\nThis building’s façade combines classical stylistic influences, which are visible on the central doorway and the two symmetrical lateral volumes, and Muslim influences, as seen in the use of unpolished brick, classical Mozarabic elements and the arabesque-like geometrical composition.\n\nAmong paintings, sculptures and drawings, books, and engravings, the collection has examples of every aspect of Tàpies’ artistic output and of the different typologies, techniques and materials he uses. The collection includes a selection of drawings and portraits from the forties, a major group of the matter paintings of the fifties and sixties, a large number of object works from the sixties and early seventies, and others done with foam-rubber or the spray technique, varnishes and fireclay from the eighties, and objects and sculptures done over the nineties, in which he experimented with new materials such as metal sheets, sometimes used as pictorial supports, or bronze. Further, the museum has an auditorium, a library exhibition gallery, a terrace, an atrium and a museum shop.\n\n\n\n");

				"Miquel Garriga i Roca (1847); Josep Oriol Mestres (1862); Ignasi de Sola-Morales (1999)\n\nAlso called as ‘Barcelona’s opera house’, it was built in 1847 and was designed by Miquel Garriaga i Roca, subsequently assisted by Josep Oriol Mestres. Selling shares funded the project, which meant that many of the boxes and seats were to be privately owned. The shareholders formed the Societat del Gran Teatre del Liceu, known as the “Societat de Propietaris” (Society of Owners). One of the important events that happened in the history of the building is the 1994 fire, which destroyed the Auditorium and stage. It was decided to rebuild and improve the emblematic building and to create a new legal framework to put it under public ownership. This time, the project was rebuilt on the basis of pre-existing Refurbishment and Enlargement Project, drawn up in 1986 by Ignasi de Solà-Morales with later input (1986) from Xavier Fabré and Lluís Dilmé. It opened again in 1999.\n\nAs for architecture of the building, it can be elaborated in 6 parts. The Vestibule, which is one of the areas saved in the 1994 fire, is of an eclectic style, based on the Renaissance, a style known in the mid nineteenth century as “Florentine” and which was the more or less free interpretation given to the neo-Classical style in the reign of Isabel II. The Main Hall, explicitly inspired by Milan's Teatro alla Scala, is laid out in the shape of a horseshoe (maximum depth and width of 33 and 27 meters), with stalls and five levels, making it one of the most outstanding auditoria of nineteenth-century European architecture. It can host around 2,292 people, making it one of the largest opera houses in Europe. \n\nSaló de Miralls, one of the areas saved in the fire, is a public meeting area. The room, with its ceiling paintings and the curious texts referring to art and music that run along the tops of the walls, is a space where the atmosphere of the old Liceu survives intact. The Foyer is a rest and public meeting area below the main hall. It is a multi-purpose space used both as a café during intervals and as a room for small-format concerts and performances, information sessions prior to each opera performance and as a venue for business and social events. \n\nThe stage is the largest area in the whole of the theatre and the core around which the entire building is organized. It is fitted with equipment of a large scope and complexity which allows a great deal of flexibility in assembling and striking productions, scene changes and alternating titles in the program. The Espai Liceu, the last one, is on the first floor of the basement, with access from La Rambla and Carrer de Sant Pau, and connected to the Foyer.\n\nThe starting point for tours of the Liceu, it is also a cultural and commercial area for promoting the theatre and lyrical music. There is a small, spherical-shaped auditorium where visitors can listen to music and watch projections of operas, a media library, a café and the commercial area related to music and the arts. It also includes the box office.\n\n\n\n");

				"This building is designed by the renowned American architect ‘Richard Meier’ who was the architect of the ‘High Museum Art’ in Atlanta built in 1983. Known for his rationalist buildings and the use of white color, the museum also follows the same pattern and its white color also sets it apart from Barcelona’s oldest streets and buildings. This is one of the reasons it is referred to by the local media as ‘the pearl’. Situated amongst the old architecture and narrow streets just a few blocks from Gothic center of Barcelona, its architectural style has strong references to Modernism.\n\nThe MACBA Foundation manages the permanent collection, which dates from the mid-20th century onward. There are three periods of modern art represented: the first one covers the forties to the sixties; the second spans the sixties and seventies; the third period is contemporary. The collections focus on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art, although some International artists are also represented. One of the interesting facts about the museum is its location.\n\nMeier’s initial plan didn’t coincide with the Barcelona authorities in placing the museum in the old city. But, as they agreed, the museum became much more than a tourist location. It can be shown by the fact that, the ‘podium’ that was built on the one side now serves as a prominent social gathering point and a “stage” for large outdoor art. If you visit the museum in the evening, you can see the natives from the neighborhood using it as their public space. The podium serves as one of the main skateboarding point for the kids in the Barcelona. Thus, the museum not only acts as a tourist destination as an exhibition of art, but also takes you through the social fabric of the old city, La Raval and makes it worth going there.\n\n\n\n");

Based on the Modernisme style of architecture, this site offers a moment of beatitude and calm.

It was expanded in 1986 and as of now, it contains almost 15,000 pieces of art. Alongside more than 8,000 drawings one can find 217 paintings, 178 sculptures as well as ceramics, textiles and graphic works. One of the interesting facts about the museum is a separate space in the museum named ‘Espai 13’. The reason why this space was created holds in the belief of Miro of promoting emerging artists. Miró dedicated his pieces to the Fundació to be displayed only under the condition that a space be reserved to exhibit the works of emerging artists. In keeping their word, the Fundació created Espai 13, which holds exhibits of upcoming contemporary artists.\n\n\n\n");

It was conceived through a competition won by the architects Eugenio Cendonya, Enric Catá, and Pere Domènech i Roura.  Juan Claude Nicolas Forestier and Nicolás María Rubió i Tudurí landscaped the gardens. The construction of the Palace consists of the combination of traditional systems based on symmetry, as clearly outlined in its composition, and modern techniques based on building procedure, which was dominated by modern materials such concrete.  The façade consists of a central body flanked by two smaller side ones, the center topped by a large dome reminiscent of that of St. Paul’s in London or that of St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, with two smaller domes on each side. At the four angles corresponding to those of the Great Hall, stands four towers resembling those of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compastella or that of la Giralda of Seville.\n\nThe art in the interior consisted of works that prevailed in Catalonia in the noucentisme style. The decoration of this building is interesting because of the fact that there are so many different styles that are coming together so nicely. It really brings out the classical architecture that were used in earlier Spanish and European times in while using modern building techniques, and contrasts it with the decoration of 20th century art, attributed to several renown artists.  There grand medley of art by different artists were all through the same theme of showing the grandeur of Spain, one of them specifically, Francesc d’Assís Galí, through four fields: Religion, Science, Fine Arts, and Land.\n\nA restoration of the building was needed in 1934 when it became el Museo Nacional de Arte en Catalunya simply because of the fact that it was meant to be a temporary building. The architect Ramon Reventós was appointed in charge of the renovation, in which they removed excess interior decorations and smoothed the wall surfaces to prepare for the display of paintings. They also undertook the creation of an exterior water collection network to prevent moisture leaks and repaired the cracks, which had become visible on some of the wall surfaces.\n\nSince the 1960’s, the architects Gae Aulenti, Enric Steegman, Josep Benedito Rovira and Agustí Obiol have extended the palace, with the objective of creating space to accommodate the entire collection.\n\n\n\n");

The queen gave the monastery a series of privileges, including the direct protection of the city of Barcelona, through the Consell de Cent (\"Council of the Hundred\"), who had the task to defend it in case of danger.\n\nOriginally the monastery (built in white stone, pertas albes in Catalan, whence its denomination) was defended by a line of walls, of which today only two towers and one gate remain.  The church itself has a single nave, with rib vaults and a polygonal apse, and houses a Gothic altarpiece by Jaume Huguet. The façade is characterized by a large rose window. Many of the paintings inside shoe the influence of Italian paintings by Giotto.\n\nThe monastery certainly wouldn't be as beautiful and impressive without its gardens in the courtyard.   Large palm trees and cypresses provide cool shade. From the lower cloister, there are several ways to the gardens.\n\nThe monastery was built in just one year, and thus it was not influenced by any other architectural styles.  It is a fine example of particularly homogeneous gothic architecture in Catalonia. In 1984 it was finally opened to the public, and in ‘91 it was declared a national monument.

Initially, it was a fortress ‘The Citadel’ built by Kings Philip V in 1714, which was the largest fortress in the Europe. But by 1841, the city authorities decided to destroy the fortress, which was not the popular support among the masses. After some time, after opposition, the authorities finally were able to restore the park and thus, parc de la Ciutadella was founded.\n\nOne of the main attractions of the park is its fountain, named ‘The Cascada’, which was designed by Josep Fontsere. One of the notable things was that Antoni Gaudi, one of the unknown architecture students at that time, helped him. The architecture of this fountain loosely resembles the style followed by the Trevi Fountain of Rome. Apart from that, there is a lake in the park, which characterizes the park as scenery enjoyable for romantics. Also, it has a zoo, which was developed over the left over area of buildings of Universal Exposition of 1888.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n");

In 1916, construction was completed and was one of the first municipal parks in the city. This park was a result of the remodelling process to the lower area which was extended to the main entrance to the park (Placa del Nen de la Rutlla). \n\nThe park contains one of the most popular fountains in the neighborhood, the Cuento fountain.

The maze, which is what gives the park its name, is made up of 750 meters of cypress trees.  The park is surrounded by a Mediterranean forest.\n\nWorks began in 1791 when marquis Joan Antoni Desvalls i d'Ardena, owner of the lot, created the design of a neoclassical garden in collaboration with Italian architect Domenico Bagutti. Execution was made under direction of master builders Jaume and Andreu Valls as well as French gardener Joseph Delvalet.\n\nThe descendants of Marquis hired architect Elies Rogent to expand the park, in the 19th century. A romantic garden with flowerbeds, gazebos, huge trees and a waterfall were added through the middle of the park. A water canal was also added to the garden, connecting the upper terrace and the intermediate one.\n\nIn 1880 a domestic garden was created beside the Desvalls palace.  At the end of the 19th century, the Desvalls estate became the venue of social and cultural events including open-air theatre performances, and was given to the city of Barcelona in 1967.\n\nThe park is a very interesting work of art, combining the two different styles of Romantic and Neoclassical. It almost goes unnoticed through the wonderful garden designs that help the styles blend so nicely.\n\n\n\n");

It features a wooded area and was designed as a flexible, multi-purpose space. A pond at the base of the sculpture of the dragon of Saint George is central to the layout of the park proposed by Peña.

The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaudí. The focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a sea serpent. The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaudí incorporated many motifs of Catalan nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park.\n\nRoadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaudí as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaudí designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching vaulting under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his Church of Colònia Güell so that the inverted catenary arch shapes form perfect compression structures.\n\nThe large cross at the Park's high-point offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Família and the Montjuïc area visible at a distance.\n\nThe park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of parrot found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including Short-toed eagle. The park also supports a population of Hummingbird hawk moths. \n\nInternational significance: Patrimony of Mankind by the UNESCO in 1984.\n\n\n\n");

As for its architecture, designed by Francesc Daniel Molina, it possesses a unique style having influences of Gothic and Renaissance art. Originally built as a Romanesque fortress leaning against the Roman Walls, the palace was home to the counts of Barcelona and kings of Aragon who reigned during the Middle Ages.

The Three Graces cast-iron fountain and the streetlamps, designed by him, with their arms sprouting at different heights like the branches of a tree, were added at the end of the 19th century. The two street lamps in the Plaça Reial have a dark-marble base, and the central part of the column is crowned by two snakes coiled around a stick and a winged helmet symbolizing Mercury, the protector and god of trade, one of the city’s most characteristic activities. The column also bears the coat of arms of Barcelona, just as in the Arc de Triomf. The square was remodeled by the architects Frederic de Correa and Alfons Milà between 1982 and 1984, who focused on the removal of traffic from the square and the planting of palm trees. The square is twinned with Plaza Garibaldi, in Mexico City. \n\nInteresting fact: The film ‘Salvador’ has some of its scene shot in the plaza.\n\n\n\n");
